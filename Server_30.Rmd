# Assumption Checks

## Normality Assumption

The normality assumption, as assessed by the Shapiro-Wilk test, is violated across all groups (p-values < 0.05), indicating that the response times are not normally distributed within the **Server_Type** and **Security_Protocol** groups.

## Homogeneity of Variance

Levene's test for homogeneity of variance shows a significant result (p < 0.001), indicating that the variances across groups are not equal.

## Independence Assumption

The independence assumption is violated, as duplicates were found in the dataset. 

Given these violations, we perform the appropriate corrections, such as the Greenhouse-Geisser correction for violations of sphericity.

# Repeated-Measures ANOVA

With the Greenhouse-Geisser correction, the repeated-measures ANOVA shows:

- **Server_Type** has a significant effect on response times, with notable differences between Windows and Linux servers.
- **Time** is also a significant factor, suggesting that response times vary across different time points.
- There is a significant interaction between **Server_Type** and **Security_Protocol**, as well as between **Server_Type** and **Time**.

The Greenhouse-Geisser correction, applied due to sphericity violations, confirms the significance of the observed effects, making the analysis robust.

# Three-Way ANOVA Results

## Main Effects

- **Server Type**: Significant effect on response time (F(1, 16) = 59.32, p < 0.001). Windows and Linux servers display different response times.
- **Time**: Significant effect (F(2, 32) = 18.52, p < 0.001), indicating that response times change across the three time points (Baseline, 1 Month, 2 Months).

## Interaction Effects

- **Server Type** × **Security Protocol**: Significant interaction (F(1, 16) = 5.72, p = 0.029). The effect of server type varies with the security protocol used.
- **Server Type** × **Time**: Significant interaction (F(2, 32) = 34.30, p < 0.001). The response time evolution over time differs based on the server type.
- **Security Protocol** × **Time**: Significant interaction (F(2, 32) = 3.91, p = 0.031), showing that response times change differently over time based on the security protocol used.

Post-hoc analyses reveal that Linux servers using SSL have significantly different response times compared to Windows servers using TLS after one month.

# Regression Analysis of Main and Interaction Effects

## Main Effects

- **Server Type**: Significant (p < 2.2e-16). Windows servers tend to have a higher average response time by about 16.51 units compared to Linux servers.
- **Security Protocol**: Significant (p < 2.2e-16). TLS decreases response time by about 5.92 units compared to HTTP.
- **Time**: 
  - **2 Months**: Response times increase by 2.90 units (p = 0.0407).
  - **Baseline**: Response times decrease by 10.80 units (p < 2e-16).

## Interaction Effects

- **Server Type** × **Security Protocol**: Significant (p < 2.2e-16). The combination of Windows servers and TLS leads to a significant increase in response time by 20.28 units.
- **Server Type** × **Time**: Significant (p < 2.2e-16). Response time differences between Windows servers across time points are not significant (p = 0.9959).
- **Security Protocol** × **Time**: Significant (p = 2.300e-05). The effect of security protocol on response time changes across time periods.

## Three-Way Interaction

- **Server Type** × **Security Protocol** × **Time**: Significant (p = 5.021e-05). Server type affects response times differently depending on both the security protocol and time.

# Post-Hoc Tests

## Pairwise Comparisons for Server_Type × Security_Protocol

All pairwise contrasts between combinations of **Server_Type** and **Security_Protocol** are statistically significant (p-values < 0.0001), showing substantial differences in response times for these combinations, especially between Linux and Windows server configurations.

## Pairwise Comparisons for Server_Type × Time

Significant differences were found among time points, showing changes in response times depending on server type over time. For example:

- **Linux 1 Month vs. Windows 1 Month**: Estimate = -26.646 (p < 0.0001), indicating significantly better performance for Linux servers after one month.

# Conclusion

There are significant main effects and interactions between **Server Type**, **Security Protocol**, and **Time**. Windows servers generally have longer response times, with the impact of security protocols and time points varying depending on the server type. Linux servers show better performance over time, particularly when using SSL compared to Windows servers with TLS.
